# microstack
## A stack based esoteric language

### Description

In a microstack program, each character (roughly) represents two instructions.
For example, `/`, U+002F, represents instructions `2` and `f`.

Because of this, some instructions may not be easily readable or writable.

Microstack uses two stacks as memory.

Every instruction is an operation on one of those stacks.

### Interpreter

Not fully functionnal yet.

Some instructions may change.

### Instruction set (in hexadecimal)

- `0x`: push the next `x`+1bit integer to the stack

    `x` can only be `3`, `7`, `b` or `f` for technical reasons

    Example:

    ```0f8bba``` (`â€¹Âº` as characters)

    Pushes the `f`+1bit integer 35770 to the stack
- `1`: pop top, factorial, push result
- `2`: add top and second, pop both, push result
- `3`: sub top from second, pop both, push result
- `4`: increment top
- `5`: decrement top
- `6`: swap top and second
- `7`: duplicate top
- `8`: go to matching `9` if top is 0 (Like a bf `[`)
- `9`: go to matching `8` if top is not 0 (Like a bf `]`)
- `a`: push input
- `b`: switch to other stack
- `c`: output the top of the stack
- `d`: output the top of the stack as unicode
- `e`: pop
- `f`: pop from current current stack and push to other
